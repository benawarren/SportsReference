#Sports Reference Data Internship

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that I used to work on a challenge posed for the application for the summer 2022 Sports Reference 
data internship.

The notebook is written in Python, using the pandas and BeautifulSoup packages. 

It scrapes data from the ESPN and Sports Reference websites as a first step towards answering the following prompt:

Challenge: 

- As soon as NBA teams make their draft selections, we want to input new entries into our database for the drafted players. 
In order to do so, we will need to know their biographical information (birthdates, schools attended, name pronunciation, 
shooting hand, Twitter handle, etc.) so that the bio section at the top of their new player pages will be as complete as possible. 
You have 1-2 weeks before the draft to research and prepare for draft night.
